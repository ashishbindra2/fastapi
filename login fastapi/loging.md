    A "token" is just a string with some content that we can use later to verify this user.
    Normally, a token is set to expire after some time.
    -    So, the user will have to log in again at some point later.
    -    And if the token is stolen, the risk is less. It is not like a permanent key that will work forever (in most of the cases).
